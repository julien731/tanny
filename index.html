							<p>Being the People Operations Manager APAC for AppsFlyer means a lot of things. Above all, it's about <strong>making sure that everyone is comfortable at work and that the company enables all employees to perform at the highest level.</strong></p>
							<p>I'm the glue that keeps the teams together, and I ensure that individuals are empowered through recognition and positive work experience.</p>
							<p>I operate both upstream and downstream. I design welfare and benefits packages, and I mediate personal and professional conflicts. I assure that teams work together efficiently, and I stitch them back together when necessary.</p>
							<p>AppsFlyer is known for its exhilarating employee experience. Team outings and events are plentiful, and people love them. In APAC, I'm responsible for all of it.</p>
							<p>I manage a team of 5. I train them, oversee their work, coach them, and I help them achieve their goals while making sure that company needs are fulfilled beyond expectations.</p>
							<p>I have worked on a special project in 2018-2019 where I have (still am) moving 4 APAC offices (Bangkok, Seoul, Beijing, Bangalore) to new facilities. This project includes finding new locations, negotiating prices, designing the spaces, overseeing the construction and the moving.</p>
							<p>Whatever is thrown at me, I get done. Now, for the good old bullet points list of things I do.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>People: design welfare packages, implement company policies</li>
								<li>Events & outings: organize all APAC company events & outings</li>
								<li>Team Management: create and oversee work for a team of 5</li>
								<li>Logistics: arrange travel and accommodation for all APAC events, coordinate executive meetings</li>
